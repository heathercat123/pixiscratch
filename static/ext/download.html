<h1> Scratch Browser Plugin </h1>

<p>
The Scratch Browser Plugin is an optional download that allows you to use the Scratch extension blocks for the LEGO WeDo robotics kit. Eventually, this browser plugin will also support the PicoBoard sensor board, but the current alpha version supports only the LEGO WeDo.
</p><p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This preliminary version of the browser plugin is for beta testers only. It only works on Mac OS X and Windows.
</p><p>
To try it out, download the installer for <a href="ScratchDevicePlugin.dmg">Mac</a> or <a href="ScratchDevicePlugin.msi">Windows</a>.
</p><p>
To use the WeDo blocks, start by creating a new Scratch 2 project. In the Scratch Editor, click on the "More Blocks" category while holding down the shift key, then click on the "Add an Extension" button that appears in the palette. The Extensions library dialog will open.
</p><p>
Select the "WeDo" extension and click okay. The WeDo blocks will appear in the "More Blocks" palette. If the Scratch browser plugin was correctly installed, you should see a green or yellow status indicator to the right of the "WeDo" title. Yellow means that there's a problem. Hovering over the status indicator with the mouse will tell you what's wrong.
</p><p>
If you plug a WeDo hub into the USB port on your computer, the status light should turn green, indicating that Scratch has found the WeDo hub and connected to it. You should now be able to use the motor blocks (assuming there is motor connected to the hub) and see sensor values (assuming at least one sensor is connected to the hub).
